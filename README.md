TBBBenchmarks
=============

TBB benchmarks used in the following publications

Enhancing Productivity and Performance Portability of General-Purpose
Parallel Programming, Alexandros Tzannes, Doctoral Dissertation, 
University of Maryland at College Park, 2012
http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/12959

Lazy Scheduling: A Run-Time Adaptive Scheduler for Declarative Parallelism,
Alexandros Tzannes, George Caragea, Uzi Vishkin, Rajeev Barua, to appear in 
TOPLAS

They are published mainly for reference. I used a custom build-system that
uses the .xml files. Most of the information for each benchmark is found in
benchmark.xml. Anyone interested in using that custom build system can 
contact me at atzannes@gmail.com.

Cheers!
